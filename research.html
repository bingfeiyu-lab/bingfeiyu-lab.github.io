    OUR VISION
  </p>
  <p>
    The adaptive immune system is evolved to provide protection against threats
    as<mark class="highlighted-text">wide</mark>as
    possible, target and clear the threats as<mark class="highlighted-text">specific</mark>as
    possible, and evoke an optimal
    immune memory as<mark class="highlighted-text">durable</mark>as possible.
  </p>
  <p>
    By decoding the dialogue of immune responses, we aim to harness the unique power
    of immune system to design the next-generation immune therapeutics treating cancer,
    autoimmunity, and infecious diseases.

    Cytotoxic T cells are the central arsenal in our immune system to find and attack cancer cells without harming
    the healthy cells. These T cells harbor a high diversity of T cell receptors (TCR) to specifically recognize tumor
    neoantigens, which are highly unique in each patient. Therefore, it is essential to identify tumor neoantigens
    and paired TCRs in each patient to develop personalized cancer immunotherapies. We recently developed
    ENTER, an innovative viral platform to map antigen specificity, TCR repertoire and molecular phenotype of T
    cells at the single-cell level. Combining viral engineering, single-cell genomics and high-throughput library
    screen, we will develop a suite of tools to address the following questions:
  </p>
  <p class="tab">
    Can we systematically identify the "immune-visible" tumor neoantigens to prioritize candidates for tumor
    neoantigen vaccine development?
    <br><br>
    Can we rapidly identify the tumor antigen-specific TCRs in a high-throughput manner to push forward
    the TCR-T cell adoptive transfer therapy for cancer patients?
    <br><br>
    How does tumor neoantigen specificity impacts anti-tumor T cell fate and function?

    Upon antigen recognition, naive T cells start to differentiate into effector- or memory-precursor T cells with
    transcriptional and functional diversity. Environmental cues such as cytokine exposure or cell-cell interaction,
    can modulate the molecular programming, effector capability, and memory formation of antigen-specific T cells.
    Previously, we have deciphered the molecular blueprint of T cell precursors upon infection by epigenetic and
    transcriptional profiling. By integrating epigenetic landscape and transcriptional network, we identified key
    transcription factors YY1 and NR3C1 that govern effector or memory precursor decision, and further uncovered
    a unique role of RUNX3 in T cell infiltration in tumors and non-lymphoid tissues. Our lab will combine CRISPR
    screen, epigenetic profiling and functional genomics to answer the following questions:
  </p>
  <p class="tab">
    How do environmental cues reshape the epigenetic plasticity of T cells in tumors and infected tissues?
    <br><br>
    Can we identify key molecular drivers that finetune specific T cell behavior (e.g. augment killing ability,
    increase the life-span, and reverse exhaustion)?

    Advances in immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint blockade have revolutionized cancer treatment and
    improved the lives of many patients. However, this treatment can also cause Immune-Related Adverse Events (irAEs)
    where self-reactive T cells are overstimulated to attack healthy cells in our body. To minimize irAE for the next
    generation of immunotherapy, we will leverage ENTER to develop tools in targeted cargo delivery that
    specifically reinvigorate exhausted tumor-specific T cells without wakening self-reactive T cells. These tools will
    reshape the immune repertoire to provide precision immunotherapeutics for cancer and autoimmunity.
    Advances in gene editing, gene therapy, mRNA vaccine, and cell therapy have achieved promising.
