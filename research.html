    OUR VISION
  </p>
  <p>
    We are striving to unlock the power of the adaptive immune system to create next-generation
    immune therapeutics for cancer, autoimmunity, and infectious diseases. To do this, we will
    decode the dialogue of immune responses to develop protection that is as
    <mark class="highlighted-text">wide-ranging</mark> as
    possible, target and clear threats as <mark class="highlighted-text">specifically</mark>
    as possible, and evoke an optimal immune
    memory that is as <mark class="highlighted-text">durable</mark> as possible.

    Cytotoxic T cells are a key component of our immune system, capable of recognizing and attacking cancer
    cells without harming healthy cells. To develop personalized cancer immunotherapies, it is essential to
    identify the tumor neoantigens and paired T cell receptors (TCRs) in each patient. To this end, we have
    developed <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.13.472464v1" target="_blank">ENTER</a>,
    a viral platform that can map antigen specificity, TCR repertoire, and molecular phenotype
    of T cells at the single-cell level. Combining viral engineering, single-cell genomics, and high-throughput
    library screening, we will develop a suite of tools to answer the following questions:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
    <ol>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
	How can we systematically identify the "immune-visible" tumor neoantigens to prioritize candidates for tumor neoantigen vaccine development?
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
	How can we rapidly identify the tumor antigen-specific TCRs in a high-throughput manner to advance TCR-T cell adoptive transfer therapy for cancer patients?
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
	How does tumor neoantigen specificity impact anti-tumor T cell fate and function?

    Beyond antigen specificity, environmental cues such as cytokine exposure or cell-cell communication,
    can modulate the molecular programming and functional diversity of antigen-specific T cells. Previously,
    we have deciphered the
    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ni.3706" target="_blank">molecular blueprint of T cell precursors</a>
    upon infection via epigenetic and
    transcriptional profiling. By integrating epigenetic landscape and transcriptional network, we identified key
    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ni.3706" target="_blank">transcription factors YY1 and NR3C1</a>
    that govern effector or memory precursor T cell decision, and
    further uncovered a unique role of
    <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature24993" target="_blank">RUNX3 in T cell infiltration</a>
    in tumors. Our lab will combine CRISPR
    screen, epigenetic profiling and functional genomics to answer the following questions:
  </p>
  <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
    <ol>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
	How do environmental cues reshape the epigenetic plasticity of T cells in tumors and infected tissues?
      </li>
      <li style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem">
	How can we identify key molecular drivers that fine-tune T cell behavior and fate decision?

    The advancement of immunotherapy, such as immune checkpoint blockade, has revolutionized cancer treatment
    and improved the lives of many patients. However, this treatment can also cause Immune-Related Adverse
    Events (irAEs) due to overstimulation of self-reactive T cells, which attack healthy cells in the human
    body. To reduce the risk of irAEs in the next generation of immunotherapy, we will use
    <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.13.472464v1" target="_blank">ENTER</a>
    to develop delivery tools that specifically reinvigorate exhausted tumor-reactive T cells without activating
    self-reactive T cells. These tools will reshape the immune repertoire, paving the way for precision immunotherapy
    for cancer and autoimmunity.
