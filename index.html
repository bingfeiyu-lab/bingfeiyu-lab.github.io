    Our lab investigates two fundamental aspects of immune system biology: (1) the molecular
    mechanisms underlying inter-cellular immune recognition, by developing tools to link immune
    recognition and molecular programming at single-cell resolution and (2) the role of X-
    chromosome inactivation in immune cells, focusing on how this epigenetic regulation contributes
    to sex-based differences in immune responses.
