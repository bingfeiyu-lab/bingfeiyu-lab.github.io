    Our lab investigates two fundamental aspects of immune system biology: (1) the molecular
    mechanisms underlying inter-cellular immune recognition, by developing tools to link immune
    recognition and molecular programming at single-cell resolution and (2) the role of X-
    chromosome inactivation in immune cells, focusing on how this epigenetic regulation contributes
    to sex-based differences in immune responses.

    Our lab is focused on deciphering the immune recognition code, the fundamental process by
which killer T cells &quot;see&quot; and distinguish abnormal cells from healthy ones. This is critical for
the immune system to specifically target and eliminate threats like cancer cells or pathogen-
infected cells. Every nucleated somatic cell presents short peptides from its entire proteome on
cell surface using Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules. T cells, equipped with a
vast repertoire of T cell receptors (TCRs), scan these peptide-MHC complexes to recognize
specific antigens. By integrating molecular/cellular engineering, high-throughput screening, and
single-cell genomics, we develop technologies including ESCAPE-seq and ENTER-seq to tackle
the following questions:

    Females, harboring two X chromosomes, exhibit a heightened immune response to infections, however are more prone
    to develop autoimmune diseases compared to males with one X chromosome.
    <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33735607" target="_blank">Our recent work</a>
    unveiled a critical role
    of female-specific lncRNA XIST in maintaining X-inactivation of key immune genes in B cells. We will further explore
    the molecular mechanism of X-inactivation maintenance in age-associated B cells, a subset that is abnormally expanded
    in patients with female-biased autoimmune diseases.
