      <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem">
	She earned her Ph.D. in Immunology from the University of California, San Diego, where she worked
	with Prof. Ananda Goldrath on differentiation pathways of T cells combating infectious diseases and
	cancer. During her postdoctoral research in the lab of Prof. Howard Chang at Stanford, Bingfei
	explored epigenetics, non-coding RNA, and single cell genomics to develop technologies that decode
	immune recognition and molecular blueprints. She is a recipient of the Parker Bridge Fellow award,
	supported by the Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy and the V Foundation.
